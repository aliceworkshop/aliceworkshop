### Public transport information

Moving around Copenhagen is fairly easy. In general all pass types give access to all transport types (metro, s-train, buses). Metros in particular run 24-7 since they are automatic.

- [Rejsekort](https://www.rejsekort.dk/): This is the most common option. You signup to the app, link it to a payment method and then check in and check out from the app when you get into a metro, s-train or bus. The cost of the trip depends on its length but is usually between 18 and 25 DKK.
- [City pass](https://www.publictransport.dk/tickets/citypass): This allows you to buy unlimited rides for up to five days (great for the duration of ALICE) at a total cost of 340 DKK. It will be more expensive than taking two rides a day for five days, but as soon as you start doing more than that it may be more cost effective. If you have booked a hotel around the city center then in principle you wouldn't need to take the metro more than twice each day. The activities we have planned outside of the workshop are all around that area.
- Metro vending machines: There are vending machines at the metro station which you can use to buy tickets.
- Uber: Is now available in Copenhagen.
- [Donkey Republic](https://www.donkey.bike/cities/copenhagen): For those of you who want to bike, this is the recommended app. You select a bike and lock/unlock when you want to use/finish using it. 



### About Copenhagen
