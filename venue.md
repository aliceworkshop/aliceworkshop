The workshop will take place in Copenhagen, Denmark.

Founded in the 10th century as a small Viking fishing village, Copenhagen has grown into a vibrant city that blends historic architecture with modern design, cycling culture, and an active cultural scene. Copenhagen is easily reachable by train and flyâ€”[see direct flights to Copenhagen](https://www.flightconnections.com/flights-to-copenhagen-cph).
