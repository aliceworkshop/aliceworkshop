The workshop will take place in the island of [El Hierro](https://maps.app.goo.gl/TBWtvi2AZKgZtsJE6), the most remote of Canary Islands in Spain.

At only 1.1 million years old, El Hierro is the youngest of the Canary Islands—as such, it preserves a dramatic volcanic landscape combined with natural environment in form of lush forests, endemic flora, rich marine life along its coasts. Historically, the island has a rich [pre-colonial history dating back to 10th century BC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-colonial_history_of_the_Canary_Islands).

This year's workshop will be hosted at [El Parador de El Hierro](https://paradores.es/en/parador-de-el-hierro)—located on the island of [El Hierro](https://maps.app.goo.gl/TBWtvi2AZKgZtsJE6) in the Canary Islands, Spain. The *Parador* is a boutique hotel situated between a volcanic mountain and the ocean, in the middle of a huge black sand beach.
