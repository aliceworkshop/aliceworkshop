The **Artificial Life, Intelligence, Complexity & Evolution**, or **ALICE** workshop, is an interdisciplinary workshop bringing together researchers in complex systems and collective intelligence.

The fields of artificial Life, collective intelligence, and evolution, span a wide range of scientific disciplines, yet, they share foundational ideas from complexity science such as self-organisation, network approaches, agentic perspectives, and bio-inspired paradigms of intelligence. The aim of the workshop is to provide a venue for researchers from these different communities to come together with the goal of exchanging perspectives and spawning collaborations. 

The workshop is built around three pillars: collaboration through projects, interdisciplinarity and community. The focus of the workshop is to provide perspective with stimulating environment to explore research ideas through projects and discussion groups‚Äîboth of which emerge through guided self-organisation.
