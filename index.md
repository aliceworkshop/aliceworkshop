The **Artificial Life, Intelligence, Complexity & Evolution**, or **ALICE** workshop, is an interdisciplinary workshop bringing together researchers in complex systems and collective intelligence.

The fields of artificial life, collective intelligence, and evolution, span a wide range of scientific disciplines, yet, they share foundational ideas from complexity science such as self-organisation, network approaches, agentic perspectives, and bio-inspired paradigms of intelligence. The workshop provides a venue for researchers from these different communities to come together with the goal of exchanging ideas, tools, and problems.

The workshop is built around three pillars: collaboration through projects, interdisciplinarity—or rather, <a href="https://joi.ito.com/weblog/2014/10/02/antidisciplinar.html" target="_blank">antidisciplinary</a>—, and community. The focus of the workshop is to create a stimulating environment to explore research ideas through discussion groups and projects—with the goal of spawning longer-term collaborations.
