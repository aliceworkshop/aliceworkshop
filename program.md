-   Projects: projects are the heart of the workshop. The process of group formation will be facilitated around the project proposals that participants bring in.

-   Tutorials: proposed and given by the participants on relevant topics.

-   Poster session: an opportunity for participants to showcase their work.

### Social activities:

-   Hike to the volcano—worry not, it's not active ;).
