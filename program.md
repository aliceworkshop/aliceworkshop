### Main activities:

- **Projects**: projects are the backbone of the workshop. Both participants and invited speakers are asked to bring project proposals. During the workshop, the formation of groups is facilitated around the proposed projects. Skybox rooms are booked for the projects every day 9 to 17, except Friday 9 to 12. You may also use them after those hours if not claimed. Besides the booked rooms, you are free to use any of the common areas in the ITU building for your project work.

- [**Discussion groups** (DG)](/discussion-groups/) facilitated by a senior researcher, these sessions focus on exchanging ideas, perspective and problems. Discussion sessions happen as group discussion around a blackboard—rather than a traditional keynote format. This year's discussion groups can be found in the [discussion groups](/discussion-groups/).

- [**Tutorials**:](/tutorials/) proposed, given and chosen by each year participants on relevant topics. This year's tutorials can be found in the [tutorials](/tutorials/).
<!-- -   Tutorials may be theory-driven, e.g., *An introduction information theory in biological systems*, or on tools, e.g., *Neuroevolution with Julia*. -->

<!-- -   **Project presentation**: the last day of the workshop, teams have a chance to present their early results. -->
