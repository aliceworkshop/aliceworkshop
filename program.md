### Main activities:

-   **Projects**: projects are the heart of the workshop. The process of group formation will be facilitated around the project proposals that the invited speakers and the participants bring in.

-   **Discussion sessions**: facilitated by a senior researcher, these focus on exchanging ideas and conversation around a blackboard—rather than a traditional keynote format.

-   **Tutorials**: proposed and given by the participants on relevant topics.

<!-- -   **Project presentation**: the last day of the workshop, teams have a chance to present their early results. -->


### Social activities:

-   **Hike** to the [Teide Volcano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teide)—worry not, it's not *very* active ;) .

-   **Art demo session**: a session aimed at showcasing artistic or musical projects by participants. We welcome any project using technology as a creative medium: live coding, [algoraves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorave), [virtual creatures](https://sites.google.com/view/vcc-2024), experimental music instruments, etc.

-   **Social event** on the last night to close up the workshop.
