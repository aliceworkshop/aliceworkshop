-   Discussion sessions: facilitated by a senior speaker, these emphasize exchanges and conversations around a blackboard—rather than traditional keynotes.

-   Projects: projects are the heart of the workshop. The process of group formation will be facilitated around the project proposals that participants bring in.

-   Tutorials: proposed and given by the participants on relevant topics.

-   Poster session: an opportunity for participants to showcase their work.

**Social activities:**

-   Hike to the volcano—worry not, it's not active ;).

-   Surfing introduction class.

-   Art demo session.

-   Last night social event.
